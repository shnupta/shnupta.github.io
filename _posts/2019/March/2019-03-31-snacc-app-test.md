Below is the screenrecording of me walking through my A level Computer Science project - snacc.

snacc is a mobile app that enables you to search through restaurants and purchase vouchers that give you a discount, just for eating at a time when restaurants aren't typically busy!

At the moment there is only mock data within the app but hopefully by summer the app will have been ran with some test groups and ready to release properly to the public!

Anyway, here is the video. It's just a run through of a small test plan that I had to make as part of my write up for my project, but you can get the idea and feel for the app.
