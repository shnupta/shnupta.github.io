I just wanted to share some great news.

Today I picked up my A Level results and found out that I was the highest achiever in my year at college.

I secured four A* grades in Further Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.

I'm super proud of the work I put in over the last two years, and I'm looking forward to reading Computer Science at Imperial College London - starting in September!
