The editor uses VT100 escpae sequences to write to the terminal to output characters and the cursor etc. It also uses the _"alternate screen buffer"_, which originated in `xterm` but is nowadays supported by most terminals. Alternate screen buffer is designed to provide exactly this functionality for full-screen terminal programs. In normal operation, output gets added to the scrollback buffer (and most terminals let the user scroll back to previous lines). Switching to the alternate screen buffer the scrollback buffer is left alone, and alternate screen buffer output is not added to the scrollback buffer. When returning from alternate screen buffer, the original scrollback buffer state is restored. This is what full-screen applications like `nano` use.

The original editor [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) was written over a weekend by Salvatore Sanfilippo. You can read his [blogpost]("http://antirez.com/news/108") on his site.

I've taken the base of the kilo editor and have started to modularise it into different components and features (like syntax highlighting and git integration). So far I've added more in-depth syntax highlighting (needs to be fixed first though hah) and a goto function to make navigating the file easier.

Some of the planned features are:

- Git integration
- More syntax keyword colours
- More language syntax highlighting
- More shortcuts
- Yank & paste lines
- Append to end of line
- Jump to beginning of line
- Soft/hard wrap lines
- Auto indent
- Line numbers
- Config file rather than hard coded colours etc

I will continue to add more features and hopefully get more of the open source community involved, but for the moment I think having this little editor is definitely useful and quite cool really.
