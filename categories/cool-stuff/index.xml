      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting this Red Bull ad on about every 9 out of 10 YouTube videos recently. So I decided to check it out. Heading to the site you&amp;rsquo;ll find a &amp;lsquo;study puzzle&amp;rsquo; which awaits you. The puzzle consists of connecting all the dots together, without using the same dot. There are 10 rounds, with each puzzle increasing in difficulty. After a little bit of grinding out the game, my friend Jules managed to top the leaderboard with a lovely score of 1731 (I only managed to reach 6th place).</description>

      <description>Like many people, while working I like to have some music on in the background. Normally this is either a Spotify playlist of my own, or some Youtube livestream of jazz, lofi or another genre that is mostly instrumental.
Also, I spend a lot of time in the terminal while working. Putting two and two together I thought it would be cool to be able to have a CLI to play the audio from different livestreams.</description>

      <description>I was looking for a tool to record my terminal output so I could show some example output of programs I had written for some friends.
After searching &amp;ldquo;record terminal output&amp;rdquo;, the first result to appear was Asciinema .
This post is just a quick overview of what you can do with Asciinema and why I like it.
Installation Installing Asciinema is super easy.
If you use Homebrew:
brew install asciinema Pip:</description>
