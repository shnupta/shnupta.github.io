      <description>I recently finished my first year of university. It&amp;rsquo;s been a lot to reflect on, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it.
Pre-university I want to start by framing my expectations before I started in late September 2019. I had always felt that uni was &amp;ldquo;over-hyped&amp;rdquo;. So many times had I heard that it was &amp;ldquo;the best time of your life&amp;rdquo; and given my typically sceptical nature I had pretty much taken the opposite viewpoint that it was probably not going to live up to what I had heard.</description>

      <description>The last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been completing my summer project for university. This project consisted of 3 parts: an assembler, an emulator (both for the ARM11 architecture) and then a free-choice extension project written in C.
We were put into groups of 4 to complete all of these tasks which was a great experience to work tightly as a group. We shared tasks in a few different ways which was insightful.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy this week with my summer uni project. We are in groups of 4 and have a 3 part project to do.
The first two parts are an emulator and assembler for the ARM11 architecture. We split ourselves into twos and each pair worked on their own part. I worked on the assembler and it was great fun. I&amp;rsquo;m also glad we split the work this way, as we ended up finishing both parts before the deadline, when you only needed to have completed the emulator.</description>
