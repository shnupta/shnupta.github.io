      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy this week with my summer uni project. We are in groups of 4 and have a 3 part project to do.
The first two parts are an emulator and assembler for the ARM11 architecture. We split ourselves into twos and each pair worked on their own part. I worked on the assembler and it was great fun. I&amp;rsquo;m also glad we split the work this way, as we ended up finishing both parts before the deadline, when you only needed to have completed the emulator.</description>
