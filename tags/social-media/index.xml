      <description>I decided to delete all of my social media accounts. This post covers the reasons why I did this and what effects it had at different stages.
Why? One of the main reasons for doing this was to help my concentration levels. I’ve wanted to be able to invest time in more meaningful experiences lately (I’ve successfully done this with my Spanish learning however I’d like to have more time to read and do some projects and research) but I’ve found that with many things I tell myself: “I haven’t got time”.</description>
