      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy this week with my summer uni project. We are in groups of 4 and have a 3 part project to do.
The first two parts are an emulator and assembler for the ARM11 architecture. We split ourselves into twos and each pair worked on their own part. I worked on the assembler and it was great fun. I&amp;rsquo;m also glad we split the work this way, as we ended up finishing both parts before the deadline, when you only needed to have completed the emulator.</description>

      <description>This guide has been written as a complete introduction to dynamic arrays, with comparisons against similar array types like dynamically allocated and fixed-size arrays, and also a tutorial on how to implement one in C.
 Link to the repository of code.   Prerequisites: you should have a basic understanding of pointers and some knowledge of programming in C.
Let’s get to it!
First let’s define an array. An array is a contiguous area of memory, consisting of equally sized elements, indexed by contiguous integers.</description>
