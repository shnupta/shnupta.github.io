      <description>This guide has been written as a complete introduction to dynamic arrays, with comparisons against similar array types like dynamically allocated and fixed-size arrays, and also a tutorial on how to implement one in C.
 Link to the repository of code.   Prerequisites: you should have a basic understanding of pointers and some knowledge of programming in C.
