                        <p>
                                So the other night I was looking up for some nice interesting tech films that I could spend a couple hours of downtime on.
                                I came across The Social Network - its about Mark Zuckerberg and the rising of Facebook.
                                <br/><br/>
                                By the way this isn't a review or anything, just a little post to say what I thought.
                                <br/><br/>
                                After watching the film I felt this relentless want to just code something, anything that was cool or useful. I couldn't keep my mind from trying to think of something to do and it had to do something then.
                                I'm definitely not the only one who got that feeling too from reading online. The film deals with so many situations and different characters that I thought would never come up but that itself made the film so much greater than what I thought it was going to be.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The filmography and roundness of the film, along with the circular narrative makes it such a good watch even if the journey is a bit of a rollercoaster, it is an inspiring one at least and it's the first film that I really want to watch again in a while. Would recommend to anyone and everyone, especially programmers.
