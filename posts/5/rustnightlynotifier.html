                        <p>
                                I was on Twitter the other day (@casey__williams) when I came across a retweet by @rustlang of a tweet asking if someone could build a Twitter bot that posted when a new nightly build was released.
                                I had thought of making a Twitter bot before but never had a reason to, until now...
                                <br/>
                                A quick google search found me a python module that ties to the Twitter API - called tweepy. I installed the module and created a new application on dev.twitter.com
                                <br/>
                                It was super quick and simple to set up (+1 to tweepy and the Twitter API team) and so within 20 minutes a prototype was functioning, although posting from my own personal account. All it was doing at the moment was checking the cargo.toml file on the rust site and searching for the <code class="prettyprint">[rustc.nightly]</code> item, getting the commit hash with a little regex and then comparing to see if it was the one already stored locally in a text file.
                                If it wasn't, then voila! A new nightly had been released so lets <code class="prettyprint">api.update_status()</code> and post a tweet. Currently the bot isn't using anything asynchronous to wait for the cargo.toml to update as Python2.7 doesn't have a quick module for this. After exams I might write a little module to make the code nicer and to more correct standards.
                                <br/>
                                The final thing I did was just compare the old nightly build with the new one by adding a link to the comparison page on github of those two commits.
                                <br/>
                                The bot's twitter handle is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RustNightly">@RustNightly</a> so go ahead and follow to stay up to date with the latest Rust nightly builds! Also the code is available here on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/shnupta/RustNightlyNotifier">my github.</a>
