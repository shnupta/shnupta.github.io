                        </a>

                        
                                <p>Today I have set out on a personal challenge to complete all of the (free)
content on the <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university">coding-interview-university
repo</a> by John Washam.</p>

<p>I will try to document my progress with a series of blog posts alongside
repositories that I will make on <a href="https://github.com/shnupta">my Github.</a></p>

<p>If you take a look at the repository, he advises practising coding and
implementing the different data structures and algorithms in multiple languages
for practice. The most important thing is repetition, and for this reason I will
be trying to complete a part of the repo <strong>every day!</strong></p>

<p>As a quick outline, I’m 16 and I’ve been coding for about two years now and
every day I am trying to improve. One of the biggest problems I’ve had over
these past couple of years has been finding something to stick with. This is
because almost everything I discover, in almost any field, I find inspiring and
I then want to tackle it. This is good in some ways but also means that I hop
around a bit too much and never strengthen my knowledge on key information that
every ‘good’ software developer should know.</p>

<p>I’ve got a summer job at a software company in my local town and I’m learning
loads about producing real, live products that are used by real, live people.
I’m having such a good time discovering many small aspects of software
development and I look forward to learning much more! The experience should also
come in handy.</p>

<p>Any way, back to the coding-interview-university… I’ve read the first three blog
posts and watched the first video in the general preparation section and I think
this is going to be an enjoyable and very profitable dedication.</p>

<p>So I look forward to writing some more of these about the work I’ve been doing
and my progress throughout completing the course.</p>
