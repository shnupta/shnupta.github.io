                Iâ€™ve decided to write a quick tutorial on how it all works. So hopefully it may come in handy as a quick learning tool or reminder for myself, or even another person who comes across this post at a later date.

                                I was on Twitter the other day (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/casey__williams">@casey__williams</a>) when I came across a retweet by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rustlang">@rustlang</a> of a tweet asking if someone could build a Twitter bot that posted when a new nightly build was released.
                                I had thought of making a Twitter bot before but never had a reason to, until now...

                                The other day I was browsing on reddit (as you do) and came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/64277x/what_are_your_outside_of_work_compsci_related/" target="_blank">a post</a> on r/compsci
                                that was asking what are people's out of work hobbies. Someone commented that they were following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA" target="_blank">Ben Eater's</a> videos on building an 8-bit breadboard computer.

                                So the other night I was looking up for some nice interesting tech films that I could spend a couple hours of downtime on.
                                I came across The Social Network - its about Mark Zuckerberg and the rising of Facebook.

                                <br/>The talk was titled 'An Introduction to Xamarin Forms' and was presented by Martin Rock-Evans a lead software developer at UKHO.
