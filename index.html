                                So the other night I was looking up for some nice interesting tech films that I could spend a couple hours of downtime on.
                                I came across The Social Network - its about Mark Zuckerberg and the rising of Facebook.

                        <p>So this evening I attended my first software developers meetup in my local town - Taunton.
                                <br/>The talk was titled 'An Introduction to Xamarin Forms' and was presented by Martin Rock-Evans a lead software developer at UKHO.

                                This past week I've spent taking a small text editor made by antirez, adapting it and adding new features.

                        <p>This was my first little emulator of a Chip 8 virtual machine from the 80s. It runs old school games like Pong, Breakout and Tetris.
