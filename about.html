  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
      I'm 18 years old and studying A levels in Further Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics and Computing at Richard Huish College.
      <br/><br/>
      I am extremely passionate about programming and technology. I am constantly in pursuit of new challenges and projects to continue my personal development and to experience all corners of the software industry.
      <br/><br/>
      I've much experience using C, Python, C#, .NET framework and SQL Server with desktop and web applications. I've developed personal projects in hardware emulation, image processing, machine learning and more.
      <br/><br/>
      I'm currently making an app with Flutter. You'll be able to check it out soon!
