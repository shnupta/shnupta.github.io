  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm 18 years old and studying A levels in Further Mathematics, Mathematics, Physics and Computing at Richard Huish
    College.
    <br /><br />
    I am extremely passionate about programming and technology. I am constantly in pursuit of new challenges and
    projects to continue my personal development and to experience all corners of the software industry.
    <br /><br />
    I've much experience using C, Python, C#, .NET framework and SQL Server with desktop and web applications. I've
    developed personal projects in hardware emulation, image processing, machine learning and more.
    <br /><br />
    I'm currently making an app with Flutter. You'll be able to check it out soon!
    <br /><br />
